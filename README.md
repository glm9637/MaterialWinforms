# MaterialWinforms
Windows Forms Controls with Material Design

I created this library out of two existing ones:
https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin
https://sinister.ly/Thread-Tutorial-C-Material-Design-Lollipop-WinForms-UI
Because i really liked them, but felt like some controls were Missing, so i added a few Custom ones
and will add other ones as soon as i need them

## Screenshots 
This are some of the screenshots of the controls and forms built with the MaterialWinforms. You can also build Elegant and good-looking WinForms App with MaterialWinForms custom control.
